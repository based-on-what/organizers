## Configuration

### Shared Configuration
All scripts now use a common configuration system through `shared_utils.py`. You can customize:

- **Logging levels**: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
- **File extensions**: Supported formats for each script
- **Output formats**: Text, JSON (where applicable)
- **Progress reporting**: Enable/disable progress bars

### Environment Variables
Set these optional environment variables for enhanced functionality:

```bash
# Steam API configuration
export STEAM_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export STEAM_USER_IDS="id1,id2,id3"

# Logging configuration
export LOG_LEVEL="INFO"  # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
```

## Performance Features

### Optimizations Implemented
- **Shared utilities**: Eliminated code duplication (~120 lines reduced)
- **Modern libraries**: Replaced deprecated dependencies
- **Progress reporting**: Real-time progress for long operations
- **Error recovery**: Graceful handling of corrupted files
- **Memory efficiency**: Proper resource cleanup
- **Batch processing**: Optimized for large file collections

### Performance Tips
- Use SSD storage for faster file access
- Process files locally rather than over network
- Use appropriate log levels (INFO for normal use, DEBUG for troubleshooting)
- Consider excluding large subtitle/extras directories

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Import Errors
```bash
# If you get import errors, install missing packages:
pip install pypdf python-docx ebooklib moviepy

# For specific errors:
# ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pypdf'
pip install pypdf

# ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'moviepy'
pip install moviepy
```

#### Video Processing Issues
- **Codec problems**: Install additional codec packages
- **Corrupted files**: Scripts now skip and report problematic files
- **Large files**: Increase system memory or process in smaller batches

#### Document Processing Issues
- **PDF encryption**: Some encrypted PDFs cannot be processed
- **DOCX page counting**: Results are estimates based on content analysis
- **CBR files**: Requires RAR tools installation on system

#### Steam API Issues
- **API key invalid**: Verify your Steam Web API key
- **Rate limiting**: Script includes automatic retry with delays
- **Game not found**: HowLongToBeat database may not have all games

### Getting Help
1. Check the logs generated by each script
2. Run with `-l DEBUG` for detailed information
3. Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
4. Check file permissions and accessibility
